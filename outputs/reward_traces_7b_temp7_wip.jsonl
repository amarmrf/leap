One efficient method is to use a set to track the elements that have already been seen. If you encounter an element that is already in the set, then it means there is a duplicate. Here\u2019s how you can implement this:\n\n### Solution:\n```python\ndef contains_duplicate(nums):\n    # Create a set to store unique elements\n    seen = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the array\n    for num in nums:\n        # If the number is already in the set, return True (duplicate found)\n        if num in seen:\n            return True\n        # Otherwise, add the number to the set\n        seen.add(num)\n    \n    # If no duplicates are found, return False\n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Set Creation**: We initialize an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the elements we have encountered so far.\n2. **Iteration**: We iterate through each element in the input array `nums`.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: For each element, we check if it is already in the `seen` set.\n   - If it is, it means this element has been seen before, and thus there is a duplicate. We return `True`.\n   - If it is not, we add the element to the `seen` set.\n4. **Completion**: If we complete the iteration without finding any duplicates, we return `False`.\n\n### Test Cases:\nYou can test the function with various cases to ensure it works correctly:\n\n```python\nassert contains_duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False\nassert contains_duplicate([1, 2, 3, 3, 4]) == True\nassert contains_duplicate([10, -2, 4, 7, 8, -2]) == True\nassert contains_duplicate([]) == False\nassert contains_duplicate([5]) == False\n```\n\nThis solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because checking for membership and adding to a set both have an average time complexity of O(1).",

  "first_attempt": "To solve the problem of finding the nth digit in the proper fraction of two given numbers, we need to understand how to handle recurring decimal fractions. A proper fraction is one where the numerator is less than the denominator. When converting a fraction to its decimal form, if it results in a repeating decimal, we need to identify the pattern and then find the nth digit within that pattern.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Convert the Fraction to Decimal**: We can use Python's `fractions.Fraction` class to handle the conversion of a fraction to its decimal form.\n2. **Identify Recurring Pattern**: Once we have the decimal representation, we need to identify if it is a repeating decimal and find the repeating pattern.\n3. **Find nth Digit**: Using the identified pattern, we can determine the nth digit.\n\nHere's the Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef get_nth_digit(numerator, denominator, n):\n    # Create a fraction object\n    frac = Fraction(numerator, denominator)\n    \n    # Convert fraction to string representation\n    decimal_str = str(frac.numerator / frac.denominator)\n    \n    # Check if the decimal is recurring\n    if '.' in decimal_str:\n        decimal_part = decimal_str.split('.')[1]\n        if len(decimal_part) > 0 and len(decimal_part) != len(set(decimal_part)):\n            # Find the repeating part\n            for i in range(1, len(decimal_part)):\n                if decimal_part[:i] == decimal_part[i:2 * i]:\n                    repeating_pattern = decimal_part[:i]\n                    break\n            \n            # Calculate the position of the nth digit within the repeating pattern\n            position_in_pattern = (n - 1) % len(repeating_pattern)\n            return int(repeating_pattern[position_in_pattern])\n        else:\n            # If no repeating part, return a message or handle accordingly\n            return \"No repeating decimal\"\n    else:\n        # If not a recurring decimal, return the nth digit after the decimal point if it exists\n        if n <= len(decimal_str.split('.')[1]):\n            return int(decimal_str.split('.')[1][n - 1])\n        else:\n            return \"Digit out of range\"\n\n# Test cases\nprint(get_nth_digit(1, 3, 1))  # Output: 3 (1/3 = 0.3333...)\nprint(get_nth_digit(2, 7, 6))  # Output: 8 (2/7 = 0.285714285714...)\nprint(get_nth_digit(1, 7, 7))  # Output: 1 (1/7 = 0.142857142857...)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Fraction Object**: We use `fractions.Fraction` to handle the fraction and ensure accurate decimal representation.\n2. **Decimal Conversion**: The fraction is converted to a string, and we check if it has a recurring part by looking for repeated sequences in the fractional part.\n3. **Repeating Pattern**: If a repeating pattern is found, we determine its length and calculate the position of the nth digit within this pattern.\n4. **Handling Non-Recurring**: If no repeating part is found, we simply return the nth digit if it exists after the decimal point.\n\nThis function should handle various cases of fractions, including those with recurring decimals, and return the correct nth digit.",
