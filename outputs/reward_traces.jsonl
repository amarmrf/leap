Here are some examples:\n\n#### Example 1: Using `sorted()`\n```python\nmy_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]\nsorted_list = sort_list(my_list)\nprint(sorted_list)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Using `sort()`\n```python\nmy_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]\nsort_list(my_list)\nprint(my_list)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n```\n\nBoth methods will sort the list in ascending order.

Inside the function, we use the modulus operator `%` to determine if the length of the word is odd or even. If the remainder when the length is divided by 2 is not zero (`len(word) % 2 != 0`), then the length is odd, and the function returns `True`.\n3. If the length is even, the function returns `False`.\n\nThis function will correctly identify whether a given word has an odd or even number of characters.",

Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand Bitwise Operations**: \n   - The left shift operator (`<<`) shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.\n   - The right shift operator (`>>`) shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.\n\n2. **Check for Unset Bits**:\n   - To check if all bits in a range are unset, we can use bitwise operations to set all bits in the range and then perform an AND operation with the original number.\n   - If the result of the AND operation is 0, it means all bits in the range are unset.\n\n3. **Implement the Function**:\n   - We will create a function that takes two parameters: `start` and `end`, representing the start and end of the range (inclusive).\n   - We will use bitwise operations to set all bits in the range.\n   - Finally, we will perform an AND operation with the original number and check if the result is 0.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef are_all_bits_unset(start, end):\n    # Create a mask with all bits set in the range [start, end]\n    mask = ((1 << (end + 1)) - 1) ^ ((1 << start) - 1)\n    \n    # Perform an AND operation with the original number and the mask\n    result = num & mask\n    \n    # Check if the result is 0\n    return result == 0\n\n# Test cases\nassert are_all_bits_unset(2, 4) == True\nassert are_all_bits_unset(1, 3) == False\nassert are_all_bits_unset(5, 7) == False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Mask Creation**:\n  - `((1 << (end + 1)) - 1)` creates a mask with all bits set in the range `[start, end]`.

For example, if `start = 2` and `end = 4`, the mask will be `0b00001111`.\n\n- **AND Operation**:\n  - The AND operation between the original number `num` and the mask will result in a number where all bits in the range are unset. If any bit in the range is set, the result will not be 0.\n\n- **Result Check**:\n  - Finally, we check if the result of the AND operation is 0 to determine if all bits in the range are unset.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for all unset bits in a given range using bitwise operations.",

Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify Even Bits**: In binary, the even bits are those that have an index that is divisible by 2 (0, 2, 4, ...). For example, in the number `1010`, the even bits are at positions 0 and 2.\n\n2. **Set Even Bits**: To set all even bits of a number, we can use bitwise operations. Specifically, we can use the following approach:\n   - Create a mask with all even bits set to 1. This can be done using `0xAAAAAAAA` in hexadecimal.\n   - Use the bitwise AND operation between the original number and the mask to set the even bits.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef set_even_bits(x):\n    # Create a mask with all even bits set to 1\n    mask = 0xAAAAAAAA\n    \n    # Set the even bits of x using bitwise AND\n    result = x & mask\n    \n    return result\n\n# Test cases\nassert set_even_bits(10) == 26  # Binary: 1010 -> 1101 (set even bits)\nassert set_even_bits(383) == 495  # Binary: 10101011 -> 11111111 (set even bits)\nassert set_even_bits(254) == 254  # Binary: 11111110 -> 11111110 (no change, already all even bits)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `0xAAAAAAAA` is a hexadecimal number that represents the binary pattern `11111111`. This mask has all even bits set to 1.\n- The bitwise AND operation `x & mask` compares each bit of `x` with the corresponding bit in `mask`. If both bits are 1, the result is 1; otherwise, it is 0.

The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements in an iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty). We can use a generator expression to check if each element in the list is equal to the given element.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef check_all_equal(lst, element):\n    return all(item == element for item in lst)\n```\n\nThis function takes two parameters: `lst`, which is the list to be checked, and `element`, which is the value we want to compare each item in the list against. The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a sequence of boolean values, where each value is `True` if the corresponding item in the list is equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. The `all()` function then checks if all these boolean values are `True`. If they are, it returns `True`, indicating that all items in the list are equal to the given element; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```python\nlst = [1, 1, 1, 1]\nelement = 1\nresult = check_all_equal(lst, element)\nprint(result)  # Output: True\n\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nelement = 1\nresult = check_all_equal(lst, element)\nprint(result)  # Output: False\n```\n\nIn the first example, all items in the list `[1, 1, 1, 1]` are equal to `1`, so the function returns `True`.

However, this will not work correctly if the list contains multiple occurrences of the same element.

The `count()` method returns the number of times the given element appears in the list. We then compare this count with the length of the list using the `==` operator. If they are equal, it means that all items in the list are equal to the given element; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```python\nlst = [1, 1, 1, 1]\nelement = 1\nresult = check_all_equal(lst, element)\nprint(result)  # Output: True\n\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nelement = 1\nresult = check_all_equal(lst, element)\nprint(result)  # Output: False\n```\n\nIn the first example, all items in the list `[1, 1, 1, 1]` are equal to `1`, so the function returns `True`.

Shell Sort is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by initially sorting elements far apart and gradually reducing the gap between adjacent elements until it becomes 1.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the Shell Sort algorithm works:\n\n1. Choose a starting gap size (usually half the length of the array).\n2. Perform a gapped insertion sort on the array using the chosen gap size.\n3. Reduce the gap size by half and repeat steps 2-4 until the gap size is 1.\n4. Finally, perform an insertion sort on the entire array to complete the sorting.\n\nHere's the implementation of the Shell Sort algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef shell_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    # Start with a large gap and reduce it iteratively\n    gap = n // 2\n    \n    while gap > 0:\n        # Perform insertion sort on the subarray with the current gap size\n        for i in range(gap, n):\n            key = arr[i]\n            j = i - gap\n            \n            # Shift elements of arr[0..i-gap-1], that are greater than key,\n            # to one position ahead of their current position\n            while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n                arr[j + gap] = arr[j]\n                j -= gap\n            arr[j + gap] = key\n        \n        # Reduce the gap size for the next iteration\n        gap //= 2\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nshell_sort(arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `n` is the length of the input array.\n   - `gap` is initialized to half the length of the array.\n\n2. **Outer Loop (Reduction of Gap)**:\n   - The outer loop continues as long as `gap` is greater than 0.\n   - Inside the loop, we perform an insertion sort on the subarray starting from the current gap position.\n\n3. **Inner Loop (Insertion Sort)**:\n   - We iterate through the subarray using a variable `i`.\n   - For each element at index `i`, we compare it with elements in the subarray to the left of it.\n   - If an element is greater than the key, we shift all elements to the right until we find the correct position for the key.\n\n4. **Adjust Gap**:\n   - After completing the insertion sort on the current gap size, we reduce the gap by half using `gap //= 2`.\n\n5. **Final Sort**:\n   - Once the gap is reduced to 1, we perform an insertion sort on the entire array to complete the sorting.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order using Shell Sort.",

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this:\n\n1. Generate the first few Perrin numbers.\n2. Sum these numbers.\n\nHere's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef sum_perrin_numbers(n):\n    # Initialize the first three Perrin numbers\n    p0, p1, p2 = 3, 0, 1\n    \n    # Generate the first n Perrin numbers\n    perrin_sequence = [p0, p1, p2]\n    for i in range(3, n):\n        next_perrin = perrin_sequence[-1] + perrin_sequence[-2]\n        perrin_sequence.append(next_perrin)\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the first n Perrin numbers\n    return sum(perrin_sequence)\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 5\nprint(sum_perrin_numbers(n))  # Output: 19 (3 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 7)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the first three Perrin numbers, `p0 = 3`, `p1 = 0`, and `p2 = 1`.\n2. **Generation**: We use a loop to generate the next few Perrin numbers by summing the last two numbers in the sequence.\n3. **Sum Calculation**: After generating the first `n` Perrin numbers, we calculate their sum using the built-in `sum()` function.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the sum of the first `n` Perrin numbers without needing to store all of them in memory.",
