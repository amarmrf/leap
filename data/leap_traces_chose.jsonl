The idea is to build up the solution by considering smaller subproblems and using their results to solve larger problems.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Define the State**: Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to fill a 3 x i board with 2 x 1 dominoes.\n2. **Base Cases**:\n   - For `i = 0`, there is exactly one way to fill a 3 x 0 board (doing nothing).\n   - For `i = 1`, there are two ways to fill a 3 x 1 board: either place three vertical dominoes or one horizontal domino.\n3. **Transition**:\n   - For `i >= 2`, the number of ways to fill a 3 x i board can be derived from smaller subproblems:\n     - If we place a vertical domino in the last column, it reduces the problem to filling a 3 x (i-1) board.\n     - If we place two horizontal dominoes horizontally in the last two columns, it reduces the problem to filling a 3 x (i-2) board.\n\nThe transition formula can be written as:\n\\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] \\]\n\nThis is because:\n- The first case covers placing a vertical domino in the last column.\n- The second case covers placing two horizontal dominoes in the last two columns.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef numWays(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 2\n    \n    # Initialize the dp array with base cases\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    dp[1] = 2\n    \n    # Fill the dp array using the transition formula\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]\n    \n    return dp[n]\n\n# Test cases\nprint(numWays(0))  # Output: 1\nprint(numWays(1))  # Output: 2\nprint(numWays(2))  # Output: 3\nprint(numWays(3))  # Output: 5\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Base Cases**:\n   - `dp[0] = 1`: There is one way to fill a 3 x 0 board.\n   - `dp[1] = 2`: There are two ways to fill a 3 x 1 board.\n\n2. **Transition**:\n   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, compute `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of ways to fill a 3 x n board using previously computed results, making it suitable for large values of `n`.",
    "second_attempt": "Sure, let's revisit the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Restatement:\nWe need to find the number of ways to fill a 3 x n board using 2 x 1 dominoes. A domino can either be placed horizontally or vertically.\n\n### Approach:\nTo solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to fill a 3 x i board.\n\n#### Base Cases:\n- For `i = 0`, there is exactly one way to fill a 3 x 0 board (doing nothing).\n- For `i = 1`, we can either place three vertical dominoes or one horizontal domino. Therefore, there are two ways.\n- For `i = 2`, we can use the following configurations:\n  - Two horizontal dominoes\n  - One horizontal domino and two vertical dominoes in a specific pattern\n\nLet's derive the transition formula:\n- If we place two horizontal dominoes horizontally in the last two columns, it reduces the problem to filling a 3 x (i-2) board.\n- If we place one horizontal domino and two vertical dominoes in a specific pattern, it reduces the problem to filling a 3 x (i-1) board.\n\nThe transition formula can be written as:\n\\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3] \\]\n\nThis is because:\n- The first term `dp[i-1]` covers placing one horizontal domino and two vertical dominoes in a specific pattern.\n- The second term `dp[i-2]` covers placing two horizontal dominoes horizontally in the last two columns.\n- The third term `dp[i-3]` covers placing three vertical dominoes.\n\n### Python Code:\n```python\ndef numWays(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 2\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 5\n    \n    # Initialize the dp array with base cases\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    dp[1] = 2\n    dp[2] = 5\n    \n    # Fill the dp array using the transition formula\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 3]\n    \n    return dp[n]\n\n# Test cases\nprint(numWays(0))  # Output: 1\nprint(numWays(1))  # Output: 2\nprint(numWays(2))  # Output: 5\nprint(numWays(3))  # Output: 9\nprint(numWays(4))  # Output: 17\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Base Cases**:\n   - `dp[0] = 1`: There is one way to fill a 3 x 0 board.\n   - `dp[1] = 2`: There are two ways to fill a 3 x 1 board.\n   - `dp[2] = 5`: There are five ways to fill a 3 x 2 board.\n\n2. **Transition**:\n   - For each `i` from 3 to `n`, compute `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 3]`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of ways to fill a 3 x n board using previously computed results, making it suitable for large values of `n`.",
